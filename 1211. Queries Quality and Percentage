1211. Queries Quality and Percentage

Table: Queries

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| query_name  | varchar |
| result      | varchar |
| position    | int     |
| rating      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table may have duplicate rows.
This table contains information collected from some queries on a database.
The position column has a value from 1 to 500.
The rating column has a value from 1 to 5. Query with rating less than 3 is a poor query.
 

We define query quality as:

The average of the ratio between query rating and its position.

We also define poor query percentage as:

The percentage of all queries with rating less than 3.

Write a solution to find each query_name, the quality and poor_query_percentage.

Both quality and poor_query_percentage should be rounded to 2 decimal places.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Queries table:
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| query_name | result            | position | rating |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
| Dog        | Golden Retriever  | 1        | 5      |
| Dog        | German Shepherd   | 2        | 5      |
| Dog        | Mule              | 200      | 1      |
| Cat        | Shirazi           | 5        | 2      |
| Cat        | Siamese           | 3        | 3      |
| Cat        | Sphynx            | 7        | 4      |
+------------+-------------------+----------+--------+
Output: 
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| query_name | quality | poor_query_percentage |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
| Dog        | 2.50    | 33.33                 |
| Cat        | 0.66    | 33.33                 |
+------------+---------+-----------------------+
Explanation: 
Dog queries quality is ((5 / 1) + (5 / 2) + (1 / 200)) / 3 = 2.50
Dog queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33

Cat queries quality equals ((2 / 5) + (3 / 3) + (4 / 7)) / 3 = 0.66
Cat queries poor_ query_percentage is (1 / 3) * 100 = 33.33


Solution:

SELECT 
    query_name,
    ROUND(SUM(rating / position) / COUNT(*) , 2 ) AS quality,
    ROUND(SUM(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage 
FROM 
    Queries
GROUP BY
    query_name;

 // second solution 
select query_name, round(avg(rating/position),2) as quality,
round(sum(rating<3)/count(*)*100,2) as poor_query_percentage
from queries where query_name is not null group by query_name;


Step-by-step breakdown:

SELECT: This clause specifies the columns to be returned from the query. In this case, it selects the query_name, quality, and poor_query_percentage columns.
query_name: This selects the query_name column from the Queries table.
ROUND(SUM(rating / position) / COUNT(*) , 2 ) AS quality: This calculates the average quality for each query. The ROUND() function rounds the result to two decimal places.
a. SUM(rating / position): This calculates the sum of the rating divided by the position for each query.
b. / COUNT(*): This divides the sum by the total number of rows in the Queries table. This is necessary to calculate the average quality.
ROUND(SUM(IF(rating < 3, 1, 0)) / COUNT(*) * 100, 2) AS poor_query_percentage: This calculates the percentage of poor queries for each query. The ROUND() function rounds the result to two decimal places.
