In this article, we will discuss the leet code problem on how to use SQL to find products that are both low-fat and recyclable. We will take an example of a problem that involves selecting product IDs from a table of products based on their low-fat and recyclable properties.
PROBLEM:

Table: Products

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key (column with unique values) for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM (category) of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM (category) of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
 

Write a solution to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in any order.

The result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Output: 
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Explanation: Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.

Solution:
To solve this problem, we can use a simple SQL query that selects the product IDs from the Products table where low_fats='Y' and recyclable='Y'.

SELECT product_id 
FROM Products 
WHERE low_fats='Y' and recyclable='Y';
This query uses the WHERE clause to filter out products that are not low-fat or not recyclable. 
We only select the product IDs that have both low_fats and recyclable set to ‘Y’.

Conclusion:
Using SQL to filter data is a powerful tool for extracting meaningful information from large datasets. In this article,
we demonstrated how to use SQL to find product IDs that are both low-fat and recyclable. By using simple SQL queries like this,
we can easily identify and extract the data we need from large tables of information.
